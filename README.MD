# A simple compiler written in Python

The compiler performs a multi-step process that involves several components. Firstly, the lexer is employed to tokenize the input expression, followed by the parser that constructs an abstract syntax tree. Finally, the compiler generates machine code from the syntax tree.

The Token class plays a crucial role in this process, as it defines various types of tokens, such as numbers, plus signs, and minus signs. Meanwhile, the Lexer class is responsible for tokenizing the input expression and returning the corresponding tokens.

The Parser class, on the other hand, takes the tokens generated by the lexer and builds an abstract syntax tree that represents the expression's structure. Lastly, the Compiler class generates machine code from the syntax tree.

Once the user enters an arithmetic expression, the code performs the series of steps of tokenizing, parsing, and compiling the expression to produce the output. It's worth noting that this example is merely a simplified representation of a compiler for more complex programming languages, which involves a more intricate process.
